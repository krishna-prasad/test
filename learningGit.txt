Hi,

This is for only learning purpose of git command 

and second line commit

Edited from PhpStrom
// This section merge from createBranch  and the command for merging is 
	// To go to this branch
		git checkout mergeBranch
	// To merge createBranch into this branch i.e mergeBranch
		git merge createBranch

28-May-2014 : Branching and merge 
	Creating branch and pushing it to github

	// To create a new branch from master
		git branch master
		git checkout -b NewBranchName
	// Commit something in the new Branch 
		git branch // To check the current branch 
		git add ChangedFileName // to add for commit
		git commit -m "Coment what you have added"
	// then finally push to master
		git push origin NewBranchName
	
	To merge this branch i.e mergeBranch into master 
		git checkout master
		git merge mergeBranch
		git push origin master

	After merging into master delete the mergeBranch
		git branch -d mergeBranch	

	How to delete the branch remotely 
		git push origin --delete  mergeBranch
	OR 
		git push origin --delete BranchName
